# Python Code Generation LLM Assistant with Azure OpenAI Integration
Overview
This project leverages Azure OpenAI's powerful LLM capabilities to create a dynamic, interactive Python programming assistant. The assistant is designed to help developers create, manage, and optimize Python projects by generating code, organizing project structures, and interacting with the user to understand their specific goals. The assistant operates using the ReActAgent framework from the llama_index library, equipped with a range of tools for file manipulation, code execution, and user interaction.

## Key Features
* Automated Code Generation: The assistant generates Python code based on user input, optimizing existing code or creating new files as necessary.
* Interactive Project Setup: Automatically sets up project structures, including folder creation, environment variable configuration, and initialization of necessary Python files.
* Azure OpenAI Integration: Utilizes Azure OpenAI models for intelligent decision-making and code generation, ensuring the generated code aligns with user goals.
* Comprehensive Tools: Includes tools for executing commands, running Python scripts, managing files and folders, and handling date and time operations.
* Flexible and Extensible: The project is designed with flexibility in mind, allowing for easy integration of additional tools and functions.

## Tools and Technologies Used
* Azure OpenAI: Powers the core logic for generating and optimizing Python code.
* llama_index's ReActAgent: Manages the interaction between the assistant and the user, coordinating the use of various tools.
* Python Standard Libraries: Includes os, warnings, json, requests, and pathlib for handling file operations, environment variables, and HTTP requests.
* Environment Management: Uses dotenv to manage environment variables, crucial for working with Azure services.
* Custom Tools: A suite of custom tools for executing system commands, gathering user input, and managing files and directories.

## Getting Started
* Clone the repository and explore the existing code.
* Set up your environment using the provided requirements.txt and .env files.
* Run the assistant and see how it can help streamline your Python projects.
* Contribute new tools or features to expand the assistant's capabilities.
